# Single-Trait-Pool-GWAS-Methods
This repository contains the `R` scripts written to perform Pool GWAS for a one dimensional trait. It implements the methodology proposed in our article **Pool-GWAS methods for multiple complex traits** and applies it to simulated data. The script `SingleTrait_PoolGWAS.R` contains the codes to implement our method for one instance of simulated phenotype. The other script `SingleTrait_PoolGWAS_Simulation.R` contains the codes of our simulation studies, where we have simulated $100$ different instances of phenotype. This is a sample script and corresponds to only one case of our simulation where we took $10$ clusters and Original Stability Selection was applied with $\tau=0.9$ and $PFER=1$.
